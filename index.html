            <p><br>Hello! My name is Mitchell Winters and I am from Las Vegas, NV. 
            I'm currently working on a degree in Software Development. I work full-time 
            as a remote technical support representative for a software company. I enjoy 
            playing basketball, pickleball, and golf in my spare time. I have one 
            older brother and two younger sisters. I grew up in Washington State, but have 
            lived in Nevada for 10+ years now.  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
